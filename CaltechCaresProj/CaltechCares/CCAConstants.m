Suicide is also related to schizophrenia, alcoholism/substance abuse and personality disorders. Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison, a noted researcher on bipolar disorder and suicide, reports that \"in all of the major investigations to date, 90-95 percent of people who committed suicide had a diagnosable psychiatric illness.\" These psychiatric disorders are treatable, meaning most suicides are preventable.", @"2Myth: Suicide is the result of an impulsive action on the part of the individual.\n\nReality: Most suicides are the culmination of a protracted process, often over a 2-year period that results in a person taking their life. Initially, the person experiences a loosening of their own and societal inhibition against suicide. There is a shift from thinking of suicide as immoral or unthinkable to seeing it as a viable option over time. When a person begins to consider how they might take their life they are more at risk if they have acquired the means to take their life and have a plan and intention to carry their plan out.

They occur when the body is unexpectedly sent into a state of physiological arousal. Sometimes there is an clear trigger, but many times there is not. Panic attacks are a natural and instinctual reaction – the fight or flight response – that gets triggered in a situation when it is not necessary or helpful. They typically reach peak intensity within 10 minutes and can last up to 20 or 30 minutes, though infrequently they can last up to an hour.", @"1Signs and Symptoms", @"2Palpitations, pounding heart or rapid heart rate", @"2Sweating, trembling, or shaking", @"2Shortness of breath, sensations of choking or smothering", @"2Chest pain or discomfort", @"2Abdominal distress or nausea", @"2Dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, unsteady", @"2Feelings of unreality or feeling detached from yourself", @"2Fear of losing control, going crazy, or dying", @"2Numbness or tingling", @"2Chills or hot flashes"],

They cannot cause you to have a heart attack or go into  cardiac arrest, and they will not cause you to suffocate or faint.", @"As much as possible, focus your attention on your breath and try to keep breathing as normally as possible. Keeping your breathing regular is a good way to shorten the duration and intensity of a panic attack. Remind yourself that you are safe and that this will pass.", @"It is very common to have intense feelings of worry about the physical symptoms of the panic attack. In turn, these worries keep you feeling anxious and accidentally prolong the experience of panic. As much as possible, then, try to keep your attention on what is happening in the present – not what might happen in the future. If you can, label each sensation and experience as it arises. For instance, say privately to yourself, “I’m noticing my heart beating faster...now I’m noticing my stomach churning...now I’m noticing that I think this is never going to stop...”, and so on. Labeling experiences in this way can help you not get overly caught up in them.", @"After the panic attack is over, if you find yourself continuing to worry about the physical symptoms of panic, it can be reassuring to talk with a counselor or physician to learn more about coping with panic attacks."]
